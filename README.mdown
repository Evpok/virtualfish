# virtualfish
A Fish Shell wrapper for Ian Bicking's virtualenv, somewhat loosely based on Doug Hellman's virtualenvwrapper for Bash.

## Installation
1. Source `virtual.fish` somewhere in your `~/.config/fish/config.fish`, like this:
		. path/to/virtual.fish
2. virtualfish does not change your prompt automatically. You will need to edit your `fish_prompt` function (using `funced` or similar) to check if the variable `VIRTUAL_ENV` is set, and display `(basename $VIRTUAL_ENV)` somewhere.

## Usage

### Commands
* `acvirtualenv <envname>` - Activate a virtualenv. (Note: Doesn't use the `activate.fish` script provided by virtualenv.)
* `devirtualenv` - Deactivate the current virtualenv.

### Variables
* `VIRTUAL_ENV` - Path to the currently active virtualenv. Use `basename` to get the virtualenv's name.

### Configuration Variables
All of these must be set before `virtual.fish` is sourced.

* `VIRTUALFISH_HOME` (default: `~/.virtualenvs`) - where all your virtualenvs are kept.
